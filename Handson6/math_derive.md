Now, let's derive the average runtime complexity of the non-random pivot version of quicksort.

The worst-case time complexity of the non-random pivot quicksort is O(n^2), which occurs when the input array is already sorted or reverse sorted, and the pivot is chosen as the minimum or maximum element every time.

The best-case time complexity of the non-random pivot quicksort is O(n log n), which occurs when the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves at each step.

The average case time complexity of the non-random pivot quicksort can be derived as follows:

Let T(n) be the average time complexity for an array of size n.

In the average case, we assume that the pivot divides the array into two parts of roughly equal size. Let's assume that there's a constant fraction ε (0 < ε < 1) such that the smaller partition is of size εn and the larger partition is of size (1 - ε)n.

Then, we can express T(n) as follows:

T(n) = O(n) + (1 - ε)T(n - 1) + εT(1) + O(n)

Where:

The O(n) term comes from the partitioning step.
(1 - ε)T(n - 1) represents the recursive call on the larger partition.
εT(1) represents the recursive call on the smaller partition (assuming constant time to sort a very small array).
O(n) is the time taken for partitioning.
Solving this recurrence relation will give us the average time complexity of the non-random pivot quicksort. However, the exact solution can be quite complex and may involve probabilistic analysis.

In practice, the average case time complexity is O(n log n), similar to the best case, but with a higher constant factor due to the overhead of partitioning and recursion.
