# Question : 

Given a dynamic table that doubles in size when it needs more space, find the amoritized runtime for inserting n elements.

1. Use the aggregate method
2. Use the accounting method

# Answer : 

# Aggregate method 

In the aggregate method, we calculate the total cost of all n insertions and then divide it by n to find the average cost per insertion.

Let's denote the cost of inserting n elements as T(n). In this case, inserting each element costs O(1) on average, but whenever the table needs to be resized (which happens 
logn times), the cost becomes O(n) since all existing elements must be copied to the new table.

using the aggregate method, the total cost of inserting n elements is: O(n)

# Accounting method

In the accounting method, we charge more for each operation than it actually costs, and we use these excess charges to pay for future expensive operations.

Since each resize operation costs O(n), we need to ensure that we have enough excess charges to cover it.

Given that there are logn resize operations, each costing O(n), we can set ci =2n for each insertion operation i. 
This ensures that the sum of excess charges covers the total cost of resizing.

Now, when we insert an element, we charge O(1) (the actual cost) and store O(1) in an accounting "bank". When a resize occurs, we use the O(n) stored in the bank to pay for it.

Therefore, the amortized runtime for inserting n elements using the accounting method is O(1).

Both methods result in the same amortized runtime complexity, O(1), for inserting n elements.
